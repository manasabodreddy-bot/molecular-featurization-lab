# Molecular Featurization Lab

## Overview

This repository explores how different molecular featurization strategies influence the representation of chemical space. The focus is on understanding how molecules are encoded for machine learning tasks, rather than on building or benchmarking predictive models.

The project is intended as a conceptual and exploratory study.

## Motivation

Molecular machine learning relies heavily on how chemical structures are represented numerically. Different featurization choices can emphasize or obscure structural relationships between molecules, which in turn affects downstream analysis and modeling.

This project examines these effects through visualization and exploratory analysis.

## Chemical Space Visualization

The repository includes a representative visualization (`chemical_space.png`) showing how molecules are distributed in a reduced chemical space after featurization.

Such visualizations are useful for:
- inspecting structural diversity
- identifying clustering behavior
- understanding representation biases

## Scope and Limitations

- This project focuses on representation and visualization.
- It does not include predictive modeling or performance comparisons.
- Results are intended for qualitative understanding rather than quantitative benchmarking.

## Intended Use

This repository is intended for:
- educational exploration of molecular representations
- building intuition about chemical space
- supporting future modeling or featurization studies
